Disco
======
 
Welcome to Disco!

Disco is a framework for making building network exposed service interfaces easy. It supports multiple paradigms of interface interaction over multiple network transports and protocols. It has an asynchronous core, supporting high throughput, highly concurrent implementations, and yet offers simpler synchronous interfaces when you want to trade speed for simpler code. It also comprises an interface definition language, client and server stub generator, plus a whole bunch of other goodies to make your life as simple as possible and to free you up to implement your business logic.
